    "Each group of 4 ones and zeros here represents one stock's data (if you count up all the rows shown, you get 28 which represents all the blue chip stocks we used). The rightmost value in each row is the \"expected output\". By default (you can change all these settings in the keyword arguments of nn.get_tt_data), this tells us whether the stock went up by 4% within 10 days of the end of the data that the neural network has access to. Essentially, we truncate the data that the neural network has access to. Then we use that shortened data set to try to predict the \"future\" (we have the \"future\" data already, we are using it to see if the neural network can make accurate predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the other three numbers represent the different metrics. At current, there's only three metrics coded in, but I plan to expand this later. The three metrics coded in for now are bbands_bottom, ma_crossover, and rsi_crossover. bbands_bottom gives 1 if the stock's price is below one standard deviation from its mean, and 0 if it isn't that low. ma_crossover gives 1 if the short period (25 days) moving average is higher than the long period moving average (250 days). rsi_crossover is very similar to ma_crossover, but it uses the so called \"relative strength index\" as a measure of how the stock is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the neural network has the metrics, the idea is that it will weight each metric by a given amount (call these weights w_i). Then, it takes a look at the \"total prediction\" which is the sum of w_i * m_i where m_i is the i'th metric. Basically, we just look at a weighted sum of the metrics. Then a reLU activation function is applied where if the total prediction is higher than some specified value, then the neural network predicts a \"1\" which corresponds to \"buy the stock\". Anything below the specified value of the total prediction means that the neural network returns a \"0\" which corresponds to \"don't buy the stock\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what the neural network is doing, is it's using the last column of our training data (the \"expected output\") to optimize the weights, w_i. By using the training/testing data to optimize the weights, the idea is that we can let the computer figure out which metrics are actually the best indicators of whether a stock will go up or down. Perhaps it's actually some funky combination of all the metrics that best indicates whether a stock will go up or down. Now let's see how to check the accuracy of our neural network and also use it to predict things about other stocks. This is where the code gets buggy and needs some work."
