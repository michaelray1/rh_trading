    "\n",
    "Each row in our data consists of of 5 values. Four of these are our metrics and are either plus one or minus one. The rightmost value in each row is the \"expected output\" or \"target value\". By default (you can change all these settings in the keyword arguments of nn.get_tt_data), this tells us whether the stock went up by 4% within 10 days of the end of the data that the neural network has access to. Essentially, we truncate the data such that the neural network only has access to data up to 10 trading days before the present day. Then we use that truncated data set to try to predict the \"future\" (we have the \"future\" data already, we are using it to see if the neural network can make accurate predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a feel for what these metrics are, let's look at an example of one. One of the metrics is called bbands_bottom and it has a value of +1 or -1 (as do all our metrics in this scheme). bbands_bottom gives +1 if the stock's price is below one standard deviation (the number of std deviations can be changed in the code) from its long-term mean, and -1 if it higher than that. This is basically saying \"give a positive point to the buy signal if the stock seems lower than it should be and give a negative point to the buy signal if the stock does not seem lower than it should be\". It is based in the idea that stocks over long periods of time, will generally exhibit mean reversion.\n",

    "Once the neural network has the metrics, the idea is that it will weight each metric by a given amount (we called these weights $w_i$). Then, it takes a look at the \"total prediction\" which is $S$. Then we apply a reLU activation function to $S$ and the neural network predicts a \"1\" which corresponds to \"buy the stock\" or \"0\" which corresonds to \"don't buy the stock\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what the neural network is doing, is it's using the last column of our training data (the \"expected output\") to optimize the weights, w_i. By using the training/testing data to optimize the weights, the idea is that we can let the computer figure out which metrics are actually the best indicators of whether a stock will go up or down. Perhaps it's actually some funky combination of all the metrics that best indicates whether a stock will go up or down. Let's see how to check the accuracy of our neural network and also use it to predict things about other stocks."
