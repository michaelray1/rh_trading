# rh_trading

This repository contains a file, robin.py, that contains Python code for analyzing stock behavior and making predictions using a simple neural network. The basic strategy is geared towards making large gains through a large number of small-ish trades. This means my goal is to predict, for instance, whether a stock increases by 3% over the next week (My code allows for the user to change the percentage and length of time in this goal).
The repository also contains Robin_trading_demo.ipynb. This is a jupyter notebook that walks you through how to use the code and some of the features.
