# rh_trading

This repository is new and will be populated with code used to trade stocks using the robin hood API robin_stocks. Once I have code written to analyze stock behavior and trade accordingly, perhaps I will add a jupyter notebook to show how to use the code. For now I am just working on getting functions written that will help with deciding which stocks to trade/buy and when.
