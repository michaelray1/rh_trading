# rh_trading

This repository contains a file, robin.py, that contains Python code for analyzing stock behavior and making predictions using a simple neural network. It is not regularly updated and is still in the developmental stages.
Also contains Robin_trading_demo.ipynb. This is a jupyter notebook that walks you through how to use the code and some of the features. This is not polished, and there are still bugs in the code, but it will be updated whenever the code gets debugged. Note that you need to robin_stocks robinhood API installed to use this code.
