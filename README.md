# rh_trading

This repository contains a file, robin.py, that contains Python code for analyzing stock behavior and making predictions using a simple neural network. The basic strategy is geared towards making large gains through a large number of small trades. This means my goal is to predict, for instance, whether a stock increases by 4% over the next 10 days (my code allows for the user to change the percentage and length of time in this goal).

The repository also contains Robin_trading_demo.ipynb. Check this demo out to see what the code does and a demonstration of how to use it.
