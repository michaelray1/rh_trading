# rh_trading

This repository contains a file, robin.py, that contains Python code for analyzing stock behavior and making predictions using a simple neural network. It is very much still in the developmental stages but currently works at least at a small scale.
Also contains Robin_trading_demo.ipynb. This is a jupyter notebook that walks you through how to use the code and some of the features. This is not polished, but gives a rough overview of how to use the code. 
The next steps are to increase the number of metrics used by the network. Once this is accomplished, we can judge if the neural network proves to be a good idea.
